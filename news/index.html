          The death toll in rain-related incidents in Kerala rose to 27 on
          October 17, with the recovery of more bodies from the landslip-ravaged
          areas of Kottayam and Idukki districts. While the government agencies
          are yet to complete assessment of the total losses, preliminary
          reports suggested that houses located within a two-kilometre stretch
          on the banks of the Pullakayar river were destroyed with the water
          level rising upto 15 feet.
          <br />
          The heavy rain and landslides were also reported to have caused flash
          floods in the Thalunkal, Yendayar and Kokkayar rivers, the tributaries
          of the Pullakayar. Hundreds from Kodunga, Ilamkadu, and Koottikkal
          Chappath have been shifted to the relief camps opened at St Mary’s
          School, Koottikkal, and JJ Murphy School, in Yendayar.
          <br />
          Floodwaters have entered a number of houses in Thalavady,
          Neerattupuram, Thakazhi, Muttar, Edathua, Veeyapuram, and Pallippad in
          Upper Kuttanad. Water also entered the Chakkulathukavu Bhagavathy
          temple. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 17 spoke with Kerala
          Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and discussed the situation in the
          wake of heavy rains and landslides in the state. The toll from
          disastrous flooding caused by heavy rains and landslides in hilly
          areas of two central Kerala districts rose to 18 as rescue workers
          recovered more bodies from the rubbles on October 17.

          Vedanta, NALCO hit 52-week highs, Hindalco, Hindustan Zinc clock
          record highs; here's why metal stocks rallied
        </h2>
        <div class="content">
          An uptick in metal prices will push realisations higher and inturn
          improve the profitability of metal companies. “This current rally in
          metal stocks is on the back of last week’s price hikes, ranging from
          Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000,” said Sahil Sanghvi at Monarch Networth Capital.
          <br />
          These price hikes are due to restocking demand for HRC(for white goods
          and autos), Rebar (from construction activities with the end of
          monsoon) and increase in coal prices that are used as raw materials,
          Sanghvi said. All-time high metal prices have not only sustained since
          the past few months but have also scaled previous highs, he added.
          Credit Suisse highlighted that aluminium and zinc prices have risen 19
          percent and 29 percent from 2Q of FY21 average.
          <br />
          The brokerage has increased its aluminium and zinc LME price forecasts
          too. The foreign brokerage has upgraded its rating on shares of
          Vedanta to ‘outperform’ from ‘neutral’ and has also raised its target
          price to Rs 420 from Rs 285. Nifty Metal was up nearly 4 percent with
          Vedanta, Hindalco Industries, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Hindustan Zinc
          driving the gains. Besides, aluminium major Alcoa Corporation reported
          its highest quarterly net income and earnings per share and continued
          to capture benefits from strong aluminum pricing. This also gave a
          sentimental boost to shares of Vedanta, National Aluminium Co (NALCO)
          and Hindalco Industries.

          Qualcomm Isn’t Happy with Google Using Tensor Chip Instead of
          Snapdragon on Pixel 6
        </h2>
        <div class="content">
          “We’ve decided to make our own smartphone SoC instead of using
          Snapdragon,” reads the tweet, followed by an enormous amount of red
          flags. It was supposed to be a funny lighthearted joke, but it didn’t
          really go as Snapdragon’s social media manager would have planned.
          <br />
          Hours after the tweet went live, several users have replied to the
          tweet mocking Snapdragon. In other words, the tweet got ‘ratioed’, as
          avid Twitter users would say. Most of the arguments were valid though,
          including the heating issues and lack of extended firmware support for
          Snapdragon chips. Wouldn’t you agree? Check out Qualcomm Snapdragon’s
          salty tweet below:
          <img src="Soc.JPG" />
          <br />
          Despite Project Treble enhancements, Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon
          888 chipset promises up to three years of major OS updates and four
          years of security updates. If the latest rumor is anything to go by,
          the Pixel 6 series with Tensor chip will get four years of Android OS
          updates and five years of security patches.
          <br />
          As 9to5Google points out, Google breaking ties with Qualcomm won’t
          significantly impact the company, considering the limited scale and
          market share of Pixel phones. However, Google’s ambitions with Tensor
          chip will hopefully set a new benchmark for software support, at least
          on the Android side of things.
