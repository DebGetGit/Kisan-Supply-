                potential of Indian agriculture and aims at achieving a growth
                rate in excess of 4 per cent per annum in the agriculture
                sector. It also seeks to achieve growth with equity, i.e.,
                growth, which is widespread across regions and farmers. It also
                emphasises the need to cater to domestic markets and maximise
                benefits from exports of agricultural products. Various measures
                have been taken to operationalise the policy. In pursuance of
                the policy, national policies on sectors like cooperation, seeds
                and extension have been framed.
